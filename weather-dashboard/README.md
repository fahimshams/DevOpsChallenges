# WeatherDashboard

WeatherDashboard is a Python-based application that fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities using the OpenWeather API and stores the data as JSON files in an Amazon S3 bucket. 
This project demonstrates how to integrate external APIs, process data, and interact with AWS services.

## Features

- Fetches weather data, including temperature, humidity, and conditions, for a list of cities.
- Automatically creates an S3 bucket if it does not already exist.
- Saves weather data in JSON format with timestamped filenames for historical tracking.
- Logs weather details and actions for monitoring and debugging.
